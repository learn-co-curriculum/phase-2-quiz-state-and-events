# Say we are storing a variable in state that consists of an array of values. If we update (i.e., mutate) the array and pass it to `setState`, React will *not* update state.

Given the following component:

```
function App() {
  const [numbers, setNumbers] = useState([])
  
  function addNumber() {
    numbers.push(1)
    setNumbers(numbers)
  }

  return (
    Add
  );
}
```

Clicking the button would cause the component to re-render.

## Incorrect

True

> Since we're passing a reference to the same `numbers` variable to `setNumbers`,
> React will not re-render. We'd need to make a copy of the `numbers` array before
> calling `setNumbers`.

## Correct

False
