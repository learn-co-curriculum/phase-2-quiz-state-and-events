# State and Arrays

Given the following component:

```jsx
function App() {
  const [numbers, setNumbers] = useState([]);

  function addNumber() {
    numbers.push(1);
    setNumbers(numbers);
  }

  return <button onClick={addNumber}>Add</button>;
}
```

Clicking the button would cause the component to re-render.

## Incorrect

True

> Since we're passing a reference to the same `numbers` variable to
> `setNumbers`, React will not re-render our component. We'd need to make a copy
> of the `numbers` array before calling `setNumbers`, like this:
>
> ```js
> function addNumber() {
>   const newNumbers = [...numbers, 1];
>   setNumbers(newNumbers);
> }
> ```
