# State

When `useState()` is called, it returns:

## Correct

An array containing:

- the current value for state
- a function to update that value

> Right! Calling `useState` always returns an array, which we typically assign to
> two variables using array destructuring syntax:
> 
> ```javascript
> const [count, setCount] = useState(1);
> ```

## Incorrect

A single value representing the current state

> Not quite. One thing returned by `useState` is the value representing the
> current state. However, calling `useState` always returns an array, which we
> typically assign to two variables using array destructuring syntax:
> 
> ```javascript
> const [count, setCount] = useState(1);
> ```

## Incorrect

I don't know.
