# Controlled Components

Select all that apply. Setting up a controlled form **requires**:

## Correct

Setting up an event listener to update state as the user enters data in an input
field.

> Right! To ensure that our **component state** always matches the data in the
> **form**, we need to update state any time the input changes:
>
> ```jsx
> <input type="text" onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} value={name} />
> ```

## Correct

Updating the information in an input field to reflect state.

> Correct! To ensure our **form** always matches our **component state**, we
> need to synchronize the **value** of each input field with state:
>
> ```jsx
> <input type="text" onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} value={name} />
> ```

## Incorrect

Moving state out of the form component and into a parent component.

> While holding state in a parent component is necessary in some scenarios, such
> as when multiple components depend on the same state from the form input
> fields, it is not required.

## Incorrect

Validating the information the user enters.

> Validating user information is helpful, but it is not required when setting up
> a controlled form.
