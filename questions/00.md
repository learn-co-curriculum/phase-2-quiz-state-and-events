# React Information Flow

We're building a feature in a React application to allow users to search for
particular items. When the user enters some text in the `SearchBar` component,
the `ItemList` component should update which `Item` components are being
displayed.

Here's the component hierarchy:

```plaintext
App
├─── SearchBar
└─── ItemList
    ├─── Item
    └─── Item
```

To build this feature, which component would need to hold the `searchText`state?

## Correct

App

> Right! Since both the `SearchBar` and `ItemList` components need access to this
> state, this state would need to be held in their closest common parent, which
> is`App`.

## Incorrect

SearchBar

> Since both the `SearchBar` and `ItemList` components need access to this state,
> this state would need to be held in their closest common parent, which is `App`.

## Incorrect

ItemList

> Since both the `SearchBar` and `ItemList` components need access to this state,
> this state would need to be held in their closest common parent, which is `App`.

## Incorrect

Item

> Since both the `SearchBar` and `ItemList` components need access to this state,
> this state would need to be held in their closest common parent, which is `App`.

## Incorrect

I don't know
