# In order to change the state of a parent component from a child component, you would need to:

In order to update state in a **parent** component from a **child** component, you would need to:

## Correct

Pass a callback function as props from the parent to the child and call it from
the child component.

## Incorrect

Export the `setState()` function from the parent, and import it so that you can
call it from the child component.

> We can't explicitly export our `setState()` function, but we can use a callback
> function to use our state as props in another component!

## Incorrect

Data only flows downward in React so it is not possible to change a parent
component's state from a child component.

> Using inverse data flow, we are able to use props/state to update a parent
> component's state from it's children!

## Incorrect

I don't know.
