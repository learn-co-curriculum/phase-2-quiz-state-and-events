# State and Arrays

Any time you want to make a change (adding, updating or deleting an item) to an
array that's being stored in state, you first need to make a copy of the array
using the spread operator.

## Incorrect

True

> Using the spread operator isn't always necessary when updating state with an
> array. The important thing is that whatever value is passed to the setter
> function for that state is a **new object** rather than a reference to an
> existing object.
>
> You can use other array methods, like `map` or `filter`, to produce a new
> object; it doesn't need to be the spread operator exclusively.
