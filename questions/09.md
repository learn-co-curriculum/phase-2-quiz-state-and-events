# React Information Flow

Given the following component hierarchy:

```plaintext
App
├─── SearchBar
└─── ItemList
    ├─── Item
    └─── Item
```

It's possible for the `ItemList` component to access state that is contained in
the `SearchBar` component.

## Incorrect

True

> Sibling components have no way of accessing each others' state directly. The
> state would need to be stored in the `App` component in order for
> the`ItemList`and the `SearchBar` component both to be able to access that state.

## Correct

False

> Right! Sibling components have no way of accessing each others' state directly.
> The state would need to be stored in the `App` component in order for
> the`ItemList` and the `SearchBar` component both to be able to access that
> state.
